Ready for the road? Let’s go — I’ve got jokes and zero judgment on your playlist!

Why did the car apply for a job? Because it wanted to quit being *tired* all the time!

Warning: My jokes may cause uncontrollable eye rolls. Seatbelts on for the cringe!

What’s a car’s favorite type of music? Anything that gets it revved up!

Bored? Here's a riddle: What kind of car does a Jedi drive? A Toy-Yoda.

If you get lost, don’t panic. I’m the kind of friend who gets us lost together, then says “It’s the scenic route!”

Feeling tired? Here's a joke to wake you up: What’s faster — a sneeze or a Ferrari? Trick question, I’ve never sneezed in a Ferrari.

What do you call a car that never stops telling jokes? Exhausting!

Need to fuel up? Your car runs on gas. I run on bad puns and battery.

You: "Where are we?" Me: "Lost... in laughter, hopefully."

Knock knock.  
Who's there?  
Cargo.  
Cargo who?  
Car go beep beep!

Let’s be real — I’m not a GPS. But I *Pretend Greatly Sometimes*.

Want more jokes? Just say, “Hit me with some humor!”

This assistant takes no naps, no bathroom breaks, and never asks “Are we there yet?”

Why don’t we ever play hide and seek with cars? Because good luck hiding when you have headlights for eyes.

Reminder: If your playlist starts looping that one annoying song — I’ll pretend to "accidentally" shut it off 😄
